# LifeBuddyDev â€“ Project Migration, Setup, and Handover Summary

## Context

- **Reason for Migration:** Original LifeBuddy project was stored in iCloud Drive, causing severe sync and availability issues for development and Xcode builds.
- **Solution:** Migrated the project to a local-only folder (`LifeBuddyDev`), set up a new GitHub repo ([LifeBuddyDev](https://github.com/nidhividushi/LifeBuddyDev.git)), and excluded all system/large folders (e.g., `node_modules`, `.git`, `Pods`, `build`).
- **Goal:** Establish a clean, reliable, and fast local development environment, free from iCloud issues, and set up for future production and deployment.

---

## Key Steps Completed

1. **Copied all source, config, and doc files** to a local folder, excluding system and build artifacts.
2. **Created a new GitHub repo** (`LifeBuddyDev`) and set it as the main development repo.
3. **Set up local development environment:**
   - Installed dependencies with `pnpm install` in all relevant folders.
   - Installed iOS pods with `pnpm run pod-install` in `mobile/ios`.
   - Opened and verified the Xcode workspace.
4. **Tested local iOS build and simulator run.**
5. **Prepared for future production repo/branch split.**

## Best Practices Adopted

- **Avoid cloud-synced folders** for active development projects.
- **Keep system/build folders out of version control and backups** (use `.gitignore` and `rsync --exclude`).
- **Use a dedicated dev repo** (`LifeBuddyDev`) for all development, debugging, and testing.
- **Document all migration and setup steps** for future reference and onboarding.
- **Regularly push to GitHub** to avoid local data loss.

## Open Actions / TODOs

- [ ] **Install all dependencies** in the new local folder (`pnpm install` in root, `backend`, `web`, `mobile`).
- [ ] **Run `pnpm run pod-install`** in `mobile/ios` to restore iOS pods.
- [ ] **Test full app build and run** in Xcode and Metro.
- [ ] **Update Vercel, CI/CD, and other integrations** to use the new repo and path.
- [ ] **Migrate any uncommitted changes** from the old iCloud folder if needed.
- [ ] **Archive or delete the old iCloud-based repo** once everything is confirmed working.
- [ ] **Create a production repo/branch** when ready for deployment.
