# iOS Setup & Troubleshooting

1. Install CocoaPods: `brew install cocoapods`
2. Run `pod install` in `mobile/ios`
3. Open `LifeBuddy.xcworkspace` in Xcode
4. Create/select a simulator (install iOS runtime if needed)
5. Build and run the app

## Troubleshooting
- If simulator hangs, check Xcode > Settings > Platforms for installed runtimes
- Restart Simulator and Xcode if stuck
- See error logs in Xcode for build issues
